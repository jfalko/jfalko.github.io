    <!-- <h4><b>About Me</b></h4> -->
    <p>My research interest is how the design and development of technology may be democratised. My work cover the topics and fields of interaction design, Human Computer Interaction (HCI), game design, and creativity. 
With a point of departure in predominantly pragmatist design process theory and qualitative research methodology, I have specialised in the study of the processual aspects of design and game design, most recently with a focus on hackathon and game jam formats. I strive for a close connection and exploration between theory and practice in my work, and have therefore, in addition to my research skills, obtained a broad range of hands-on skills in among other things design, prototyping, fabrication, and programming.</p>

The case was given by Ditmer and after winning the competition and presenting the concept for the audience and jury, my team were invited to present the concept for the rest of the Ditmer company. <br><br>The concept was about making the organizational structure in a small or medium-sized company clear and giving individual users an overview of their company's structure, while being simple and easy to use.<br> Our solution was the Sheerboard-concept, an automated and interactive visualization tool.</p>

        <p>As part of a summer course at Aarhus University, my team and I developed the game World Jump during August, 2014.<br> The game is for 4 players. The players control the game by high fiving each other, one pair for controlling jumps and the other pair for controlling the speed of the level. This is done by letting each player hold a wire connected to a MaKey MaKey. The purpose of the game was to encourage cooperation between the players.</p>

        <p>For my bachelor project, I developed a horror survival game inspired by the game, Slender Man. The project was graded 12. <br><br>Via a pulse sensor connected to the player's ear lobe, the player's heart rate provides bio feedback to regulate the difficulty of the game. This was to investigate how a desktop computer game can be a bodily experience like eg. a Kinect game.</p>
